# Adaptive-Filtering-using-Genetic-Algorithm


Python Version: 3.8.3      <br />
An ECG signal was obtained using a numpy function. In order to compare the results, a Butterworth filter was implemented and ploted in the end side-to-side with the adaptive filter results.   <br />
Yet, a dataset must be obtained in order to train the filter's coeffs.
